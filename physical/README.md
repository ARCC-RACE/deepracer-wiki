# Getting Physical
###### By Caelin Sutch
The DeepRacer platform wasn't just built to run in the cloud. There are physical cars and tracks avaiable too to bring your algorithm into the real world. As many of you know, the competitions Amazon hosts and shows on DeepRacer TV use physical cars and tracks.
 
 ### Cars
 
 DeepRacer cars are still on pre-order as of Aug. 5, 2019, but will hopefully be released in the coming months. For now, a few are out in circulation, earned from winners and attendees of a lot of the DeepRacer meetups, workshops, and competitions. Over at [ARCC](arcc.ai) we have two AWS DeepRacers and a fully built track.
 
 ### Tracks
 
 Tracks for running the DeepRacer are a little harder to get. There are a few printed versions out there, but unfortunately Amazon hasn't released ones that you can buy. We made a [guide](https://medium.com/@autonomousracecarclub/guide-to-creating-a-full-re-invent-2018-deepracer-track-in-7-steps-979aff28a6f5) for building the AWS re:Invent 2018 track using foam tiles and tape. Other solutions include using projectors, or getting a full track printed on Vinyl.
