# Training Locally
You'll notice as you train more and more models that costs add up pretty fast for training on the AWS platform. The $30 you get initially is only good for a few models, and after that, the bills start racking up. Over at [ARCC](https://arcc.ai) we've created a few guides to help you train locally to save money.
