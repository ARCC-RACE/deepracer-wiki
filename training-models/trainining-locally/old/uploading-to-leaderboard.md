To upload to the leader board you first need to create a "dummy" model through the DeepRacer console, you can set the time to train to 5 minutes and it shouldn't actually start any of the resources as by the time it's done creating them, it's already been 5 minutes. The annoying part is that the model information is sent off to a AWS API that is used for submitting the models, it doesn't look at anything in your account.

So what you need to do is click on the "Simulation job" link in the DeepRacer console,![Screenshot for simluation job link](https://i.imgur.com/kJhcWxN.png) which will take you to the simulation job page. You need to click on the "Simulation Application" tab, and then look for the "SAGEMAKER_SHARED_S3_BUCKET" and "SAGEMAKER_SHARED_S3_PREFIX" for the bucket and prefix for the model files path respectively. ![Screenshot of simulation job variables we need](https://i.imgur.com/0e00Kdb.png)

Now go over to S3 and into the bucket name we found before, and if the folder doesn't exist, create it, and then create a subfolder "model", so the path would look like "aws-deepracer-a47891ce-a399-4c5a-9d4b-1247210f56fb/DeepRacer-SageMaker-RoboMaker-comm-655569752434-20190614101732-1fa8b4af-38be-45f1-8a4b-bd845cf1f3d8/model". This where we drop three kinds of files which you can find in your local bucket files. The ".ckpt", "checkpoint" and "model_metadata.json" files are all to be put here. Like so ![what the bucket looks like after uploading files](https://i.imgur.com/mmdswwj.png) 

Keep in mind, the "checkpoint" file determines which checkpoint actually gets used so you can check it by opening it in a text editor. Once the files are in, you can now submit in the leaderboard!

You can check the evaluation job logs for any errors if it can't find the files. The "model_metadata.json" is important as it determines the action space which is used, but not putting it there will force the defaults to be used and screw up the evaluation job.
