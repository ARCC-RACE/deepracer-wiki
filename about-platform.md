# About the DeepRacer Platform

AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18th scale race car which gives you an interesting and fun way to get started with reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique which takes a very different approach to training models than other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.

With AWS DeepRacer, you now have a way to get hands-on with RL, experiment, and learn through autonomous driving. You can get started with the virtual car and tracks in the cloud-based 3D racing simulator, and for a real-world experience, you can deploy your trained models onto AWS DeepRacer and race your friends, or take part in the global AWS DeepRacer League.

## Parts

The platform consists of three parts:

### Car
AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test RL models by racing on a physical track. Using a camera to view the track and a reinforcement model to control throttle and steering, the car shows how a model trained in a simulated environment can be transferred to the real-world. The combination of console, simulator, and car provides a complete solution to experiment with RL algorithms and generalization methods. 

### Simulator
Build models in Amazon SageMaker and train, test, and iterate quickly and easily on the track in the AWS DeepRacer 3D racing simulator. With AWS DeepRacer you do not need to manually set up a software environment, simulator or configure a training environment. AWS DeepRacer offers an integrated simulation environment and reinforcement learning platform hosted on the AWS Cloud for experimentation and optimization of your autonomous racing models. 

### League
Compete in the worldâ€™s first global, autonomous racing league, to race for prizes and glory and a chance to advance to the Championship Cup. Every month, there are races on the simulator, combined with in-person events spread throughout the year.
